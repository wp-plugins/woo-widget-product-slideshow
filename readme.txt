* Product Category that slider images will be displayed from
* The number of products the slider will show in 1 full cycle (repeating)
* Select the Image transition effect (8 effects to choose from plus random).
* Set Slider transition Method, Auto or Manual.
* If set at Auto start, then set auto start delay in seconds.

= View the Slider in Action =

See the WooCommerce Widget Product Slider in action on the [a3rev.com](http://a3rev.com/shop/woocommerce-widget-product-slider/) site.  

= Lite & Pro Version =

All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same admin interface as the Pro Versions. Pro Version features and settings are easy to spot on the Lite Version admin interface as they are inside of a Yellow border. As the Pro Version settings are all present you can get a great idea of how they work and what is available BUT the settings inside the yellow border do not save when changes are saved and hence are not applied to the front end. Upgrading to a Pro version activates that Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow border.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member. Upgrading to a Pro Version Licence gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and hence Lifetime priority support as part of the License.


= 3 x Pro Version Upgrades Available =

This plugin has 3 Pro version upgrades available. You will see all of the available upgrade features on the widget admin panel. Each version adds extra functionality and the once only Lifetime fee is set accordingly. Each Pro version has a 5 day Free Trail evaluation period.
