= View Demo Site =

We use the WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow Pro Version straight out of the box on the [a3rev.com](http://a3rev.com/shop/woocommerce-widget-product-slideshow/) site. For more detailed explanation of all the backend working of the plugin visit the WooCommerce Widget Product Slideshow [documents](http://docs.a3rev.com/user-guides/woocommerce/woo-widget-product-slideshow/)

= Lite & Pro Version Widget Interface =

All a3rev Lite Version plugins have exactly the same interface as the Pro Version. Pro Version features and settings are easy to spot on the Woo Products Slideshow widget as they are inside of a Yellow border. The Pro Version settings are all active on the widget admin interface so you can get a great idea of how they work and what is available BUT the settings inside the yellow border do not save when changes are saved and hence are not applied to the front end. Upgrading to the Pro version activates the Pro version Features and Settings and removes the Yellow border on the widgets.

= Lite Version Support =

As a Lite Version user please post all support requests to the plugins WordPress Support forum. We do not watch that forum and posting there you will be relying on another user for support, not an a3rev team member. Upgrading to a Pro Version Licence gives 'write' access to the a3rev support forum and hence Lifetime priority support as part of the License.


= Pro Version Upgrade =

This plugin has a Pro version upgrade available. You will see all of the available upgrade features on the widget admin panel. Those Pro features include:

* Create a slideshow of products from any product Tag.
* Tag galleries make the plugin incredibly flexible as you can create any Tag ex 'Featured' assign products to it from any category and they auto show in the slideshow gallery.
* Create an 'On Sale' Product Slideshow. Auto shows any product that has a reduced price. 
* If 'specials' are scheduled the gallery auto shows the products as per the schedule. Just set it up as 'on sale' and forget it. It dose the rest.
* Set the number of products to show in each Slideshow.
* Customize the product , category, tag link text.

= Localization =
* English (default) - always include.
* .po file (woo_gallery_widget.po) in languages folder for translations.
* Your translation? Please do yours and [send it to us](http://a3rev.com/contact-us-page/) We'll acknowledge your work and link to your site.
